# Reactor Netty TCP Client Example

A small Netty TCP client to serve as an example.

To use the project first package it:

```

The JAR will be a runnable Java file. It can be executed like this:

```
java -jar target/client.jar message localhost 8080 Hello
```

To show other commands:

```
java -jar target/client.jar -h
```

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

### Building the docs

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.
